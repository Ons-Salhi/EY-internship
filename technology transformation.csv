This unnecessary complexity usually fails or requires rare skill to maintain. I focus on the application of technology to solve business problems, not create them, so businesses aren't burdened by complex tech they don't need and didn't want.

About
But you know what really gets me going? Coaching and working with CXOs to become the best while working with technology. That's where my true passion lies.
My journey with AWS (Cloud) started when I worked on an open-source project called Openbravo, and I got to travel to some pretty cool places like Barcelona and Chennai! I also worked at Yahoo and Adobe for a year, but I quickly realized that I work best when I'm close to the founder, business owner, or problem, rather than just focusing on code.
Thanks again for reading! If you're interested in chatting more, let's connect! Just so you know, there's a limit to how much I can write here (2600 words, to be exact), but I'm down to chat more if you're up for it. What do you say? Let me know!
I'm all about product development, building kick-ass engineering teams, change management, distributed teams, and re-engineering. I live and breathe this stuff, seriously! You can wake me up in the middle of the night and ask me questions about it. Throughout my career, I've accomplished a lot of milestones thanks to some amazing founders, friends, and partners. I've re-engineered stalled products in less than five months, scaled up sales teams with world-class mobile apps and backends, transformed e-commerce systems from manual to automated processes, and even designed a highly scalable digital signage system using Raspberry Pi. Plus, I've set up and scaled engineering (and non-engineering) teams in a few companies, and currently, I'm playing the role of India Director and Technology Director for Travelopia, which is owned by KKR.
Let me tell you a bit about myself. I got my first taste of engineering when I was just 16 by helping out at my dad's machine manufacturing factory. But it wasn't until I took a summer class that I discovered my love for computer engineering. And let me tell you, I fell head over heels for open-source software! I spent all my free time tinkering with hardware, installing Linux, and trying out different Linux operating systems.
After a while, I got pretty good at developing enterprise-grade application servers in Java and Python using Linux. I even became an expert in bash scripts and Python. But as much as I loved coding, I wanted to explore different types of businesses. That's why I started taking consulting roles. I worked with an early-stage venture capital firm and served as a technology advisor for a few portfolio companies.",,"Jan 2015 - Dec 2016 · 2 yrs

Before having Ed as CIO, the IT was slowly progressing, there was a total absence of directions/clarity/intents and all team members were clearly demotivated due to the highly challenging and unstable context.
Met Ed for the first time for an interview. Was lucky enough to be selected by him for a BRM position. Since then have learned a lot from him. Great Mentor with strong leadership qualities. Always confident and solutions come out of his pockets when you need them.

I've met Edward in a particularly critical phase of my career, a phase during which our internal IT was struggling with many simultaneous changes on various sides (roles, organigram, staff, responsibilities, internal political frictions, divergence of views on targets - OpCo based -, etc.).

I have worked with Ed for one and half year reporting directly to him. He has took over the CIO role in a critical period for the company starting and leading the digital transformation, and dealing with conflicting priorities in high pressure situations. He has deep technical knowledge combined with the passion for his job, an open way to manage relationships and lots of energy and motivation transmitted to the team. Working with him is challenging but also rewarding, he has always helped me to grow demonstrating his trust and support even in the most difficult moments.

I have had the privilege of working with Roy for 3.5 years and have seen Roy as a great People and Business Leader. He has a heart for people and is highly empathetic. He is sensitive to DE&I and makes it a conscious choice to stay inclusive and be respectful to employees at all levels. Roy stays relevant and up to date by closely following the business and financial position and strategies of the organization. He shows great interest in the well being and growth of people who work with him.

March 26, 2021, Elena was senior to Roy but didn't manage Roy directly
Roy worked for me directly, when he moved from Germany to grow our engineering hub in Boston. He built an excellent and motivated team and formed close relationships with our commercial leadership and key customers. He delivered immediate results in collaboration with major US carriers, including industry-first NDC-XML implementations, which was instrumental for our market share growth in North America. Roy is an outstanding leader (with highest engagement scores), a great team player, and has a strong drive to deliver innovative and high-quality solutions to our customers.

Building decoupled software is essential when you want to maintain velocity while developing a product in a global, distributed way. But, how to be sure your product works? I’m a staunch advocate of using unit tests. They are faster and less flaky than integrated tests and allow you to scale up like a startup. Among other things I will introduce the concept of contract testing and show you examples of PACT, the most suitable Java library to implement this concept.","May 2021 - Present · 2 yrs

Jose is one of those guys you really like to follow. He is selfdemanding and able to take the best of his team. 
CST® (Certified Scrum Trainer), CEC® (Certified Enterprise Coach), CALE® (Certified Agile Leadership Educator) & PCC
He is always looking how to improve the development to be more efficient, easing the work of the rest of the team.
José is a very hard worker, very committed and reliable. He has deep analytical skills but at the same time with very good interpersonal skills.
José is an incredible technician. He has a deep and broad knowledge on web technologies that becomes him in a key asset in any project or company. He is very good analyzing a problem, proposing the best and easiest solution to it and implementing it using a pragmatic approach.
Given
Jose San Roman is brilliant, thoughtful, honest, versatile and brave, the perfect asset for any company.
While I was helping ING Direct Spain, Jose let us take him out of his comfort zone more than anyone, up to the point of becoming the greatest promoter of the transformation that others started. I believe a proof of this is the talk he gave at the Agile-Spain Conference 2013.
Working with Jose has being a great pleasure and a life-changing learning opportunity.

His team-building skills are unmatched, and the work culture and atmosphere he built during his tenure exists to this day. The trust between team mates and in business relations is the value which Bartosz is always focused on.
I have had the pleasure of working personally with Bartosz, reporting directly to him for over 5 years. Bartosz is a customer oriented manager, effective in his methods, with strong leadership, planning and execution skills. He is focused on results and experienced in problem resolution, whilst being supportive, providing constructive feedback to the people working with him. Thanks to Bartosz I was given an opportunity to develop my own managerial skills and gather a broad range of experience. I strongly recommend Bartosz for managerial positions.

Caroline Thomas
June 19, 2015, Caroline was Stuart’s client
Stuart led an operational improvement programme from a period of near crisis to exceptional performance over a four month period. He exhibited a cool, calm approach working with directors to data processors to bring control, clarity of direction and, within a few weeks, tangible improvement that gave management the necessary confidence to stick to the TOC process and measurement methodology. Unfazed by set backs he was consistent in his approach with a quiet authority that won over the cynics until the new ways of working became 'obvious, common sense'. How could we have ever operated differently?! He left having trained the management team to take forward the methodology and continue to deliver improvement. The very best form of management consulting. Get him if you can!

It was a great platform to interact with other McAfee managers and engage with them, attach a face to the name and most importantly gave opportunities to drive cross team collaboration. No other leader in McAfee understood this concept of collaboration & leadership as much as Mark did.

After joining McAfee, Mark came to our Bangalore office and he presented his vision to all employees. He explained about how he was planning to drive standards in IT architecture and how his IT strategy will help in driving business growth at McAfee. For me and the majority on the audience, it was easy to understand and connect the dots between IT strategy & business strategy.
Guillermo Diaz Jr
Mark, despite coming in as the CIO has this ability to connect across a broad section of people particularly with middle management & software engineers. His ability to talk across lines even to a software engineer and yet connect with them is something that I did not see in the past CIOs at McAfee.
Mark has this ability to get the best out of people, to motivate and inspire them at a 1 on 1 level.
I had the pleasure of working with Mark and his organization for nearly 5 years as a CIO at McAfee and Electronic Arts where successfully worked to transform the IT infrastructure and leverage his suppliers & partners to deliver on his strategies to drive business innovation. Mark's unique talents are in his ability to connect with people -- his employees, suppliers, partners, as well as his professional network to leverage the best in everyone. Under his leadership, he inspires everyone to be their best and as a result is able to attract and retain top talent that deliver business outcomes. While Mark sets high expectations, he is an excellent coach, mentor and collaborator along the journey.
I have known Mark for around 4+ years in McAfee, from the time he came in as the CIO. It is a great privilege to be writing this note about Mark, whom I consider a very inspirational leader. 
Bala Kalyana profile picture
For e.g. Mark met all the IT managers in our Bangalore office in a 1 to 1 setting. For me this is unthinkable that a CIO can do spending so much of his valuable time. I remember in my 1 to 1 session, Mark was patiently listening and taking notes. That was may be the first time in my career that a senior VP & CIO was listening & taking notes of what I shared. I really felt valued and inspired that Mark wanted me to think like a leader.

Another initiative that I really enjoyed, and which was also a highly successful program called the LEAP (Leadership Excellence Acceleration Program), where Mark called in all the managers across the globe to the US HQ to drive collaboration within McAfee IT, which until then was operating in a silo.
I found him to be the most tech savvy CIO – in other words, his knowledge of technology was very deep and detailed for a CIO that most of the audience could connect immediately. His approach was something that I really liked – consultative, participatory & leadership driven.
November 3, 2013,Guillermoworked withMarkon the same team
I have known Mark for now 14 years when he hired me at Cisco. During my period of working for Mark, I learned what it takes to run a fast paced Internet-speed company like Cisco that was moving itself toward a large, scalable company. He is a great coach, mentor and friend and is certainly a great leader of people and pushes the edge of technology, constantly. Growing up through the ranks of Silcon Valley, Mark has the leadership, relationships, and technical depth to lead any company who wants to accelerate their business. Great leader... Great friend.
In closing, Mark’s vision, plan & drive towards IT architectural standards & focus on people, leadership laid a solid foundation for continued business growth and for McAfee IT to embrace the cloud computing technologies with ease. I had my best moments when Mark were the CIO.
