J'ai eu le plaisir de travailler avec Amira durant une partie de son expérience chez SunGard, et j'en retiens d'excellents souvenirs. 
Volontaire, dynamique et dévouée, Amira dispose de toutes les qualités nécessaires pour réussir dans ce domaine qui lui est très cher : les Ressources Humaines.
Durant notre collaboration les challenges furent excitants, et la contribution d’ Amira fut essentielle pour y parvenir.
