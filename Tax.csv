Elva-Donnelle KOMBA-MANDEGHA,"      Tunis, Tunisia",      Étudiante en Master 2 professionnel Droit fiscal | Tax,"
Et bien pour moi, il est injuste que certains paient leur juste part d’impôt alors que d’autres y échappent pour des raisons d’évasion fiscale ou de fraude suite aux failles existantes dans la législation fiscale.
A travers mon futur poste, je compte alors veiller aux respect des normes fiscales et comptables par les dossiers que j’aurai en charge, mais aussi assurer des déclarations cohérentes et exactes.
# Etudiante # Fiscalité / Tax # Comptabilité #Juriste
Ma devise ""Diversifier ses connaissances, être polyvalent et multiplier ses expériences.""
Désormais l'expérience professionnelle compte plus que la formation, je reste ainsi ouverte à toute opportunité.
Vous vous demandez certainement pourquoi j’ai choisi cette formation?
Je considère aussi qu’un bon fiscaliste doit pouvoir concilier fiscalité et comptabilité, c’est pourquoi pour une formation plus complète, j’envisage faire un second Master en comptabilité et des stages dans le même domaine.
About
Je vise également à diversifier mes domaines d’intervention après quelques années d’expérience ( Inspecteur des impôts, expert comptable et consultant ).
Je m'intéresse alors particulièrement aux redressements fiscaux car je considère que l’Etat doit couvrir ses charges, répondre aux besoins sociaux et que tous les contribuables doivent acquitter leurs obligations fiscales.
Ayant un fort attrait pour la fiscalité et la comptabilité, je compte faire carrière après l’obtention de mon Master Droit fiscal en tant que juriste fiscaliste.",,"

Bassem fait preuve d’une grande maitrise de ses dossiers, d’une réelle capacité de synthèse et d’une curiosité indispensable au spectre important des sujets traités.
Je recommande Bassem Benzayed, eu égard à son grand dynamisme et esprit d'alerte en matière d'audit de haut niveau, de neutralité et de rigueur. Sa grande culture et son appétence pour la gestion publique méritent largement d'appuyer son parcours vers des carrières hors de son pays natal, partout dans le monde, conformément au principe de diversité et de coopération.
Consultant spécialiste des Stratégies et Politiques Publiques de l'Emploi chez Hollved Egor
Par la présente, j’ai le plaisir de vous recommander Monsieur Bassem BENZAYED que j’ai connu grâce à mes activités professionnelles au sein du Bureau Internationale du Travail de Genève, pour lequel j’ai souvent été amené à réaliser des missions de conseil et d’appui en Tunisie pour le Ministère de la Formation Professionnelle et de l’Emploi (MFPE) et de son opérateur de service public de l’emploi : l’ANETI.

zohra baccouchi profile picture
C’est au cours d’ateliers de réflexion et de travail que j’ai rencontré à maintes reprises Monsieur Bassem BENZAYED, représentant l'administration fiscale tunisienne en tant qu’expert, dans lesquels, ses interventions ont toujours été menées avec discernement et une grande détermination. Il a toujours su définir les enjeux avec une grande clairvoyance pour y répondre efficacement. J’ai ainsi pu mesurer ses valeurs qui des réfèrent au principe du progrès social qui est bien un des aspects des missions du BIT. Nos discussions autour du droit du travail, de la sécurité sociale, du travail décent, pour ne citer que quelques exemples, ont prouvé son inclinaison à faire que ses actions sont tournées vers le bien commun.

Bassem fait preuve d’une grande maitrise de ses dossiers, d’une réelle capacité de synthèse et d’une curiosité indispensable au spectre important des sujets traités.
Je recommande Bassem Benzayed, eu égard à son grand dynamisme et esprit d'alerte en matière d'audit de haut niveau, de neutralité et de rigueur. Sa grande culture et son appétence pour la gestion publique méritent largement d'appuyer son parcours vers des carrières hors de son pays natal, partout dans le monde, conformément au principe de diversité et de coopération.
Consultant spécialiste des Stratégies et Politiques Publiques de l'Emploi chez Hollved Egor
Par la présente, j’ai le plaisir de vous recommander Monsieur Bassem BENZAYED que j’ai connu grâce à mes activités professionnelles au sein du Bureau Internationale du Travail de Genève, pour lequel j’ai souvent été amené à réaliser des missions de conseil et d’appui en Tunisie pour le Ministère de la Formation Professionnelle et de l’Emploi (MFPE) et de son opérateur de service public de l’emploi : l’ANETI.

bassem était parmi mes meilleurs consultants. je le recommande également pour toute intervention en matière d'audit financier.
zohra baccouchi profile picture
C’est au cours d’ateliers de réflexion et de travail que j’ai rencontré à maintes reprises Monsieur Bassem BENZAYED, représentant l'administration fiscale tunisienne en tant qu’expert, dans lesquels, ses interventions ont toujours été menées avec discernement et une grande détermination. Il a toujours su définir les enjeux avec une grande clairvoyance pour y répondre efficacement. J’ai ainsi pu mesurer ses valeurs qui des réfèrent au principe du progrès social qui est bien un des aspects des missions du BIT. Nos discussions autour du droit du travail, de la sécurité sociale, du travail décent, pour ne citer que quelques exemples, ont prouvé son inclinaison à faire que ses actions sont tournées vers le bien commun.

Dhouha is an extremely personable and competent young woman. It was an honor to have her as a participant on the global consulting program that I organized on behalf of the R.H. Smith School of Business in Maryland and the Mediterranean School of Business in Tunis. Dhouha proved to be very resourceful and hardworking as well as a very apt leader for her team, which involved students from various different nationalities.
