There is no better colleague than Faten. She is one of the most dedicated professionals I’ve worked with and willing to put that extra help whenever you need it. Her expertise as a manager and a leader is considerable, and it helped our team come up with more efficient solutions on different projects. Her contribution is valuable, and I highly recommend Faten and would love to work with her again.
