Association Youth Clubs · Part-time
The YOUTH CLUBs Association establishes clubs of pupils and students within high schools and universities located in Tunisia and equips them so that they each plead for a better education directly with their own educational community. Being a member of LPM Youth Club not only developed my social skills but also gave me the opportunity to work under supervision on senior on a national scale.
TITC is one the biggest projects I've worked on. I designed the visual brand identity and worked on sharing my knowledge with the community. I got to know many awesome people such as famous guests, professional speakers and talented group members. Not only have I developed my professional skills but I made a wide network in this group!

Au cours de mes années à Collège LASALLE , j'ai été formée aux aménagements de diverses structures durant mes projets, ainsi que le développement d’objets quotidiens. De plus, la maîtrise de logiciels (Photoshop, Illustrator, Autocad, Sketchup, 3DS max, Adobe Première Pro), me donnent la possibilité d’optimiser mon travail.
About
Par ailleurs, ayant déjà travaillée dans la commercialisation, dans des boites d'architecture et maintenant en tant que designer et conceptrice de mobilier, me donnent la possibilité d’être polyvalente pour tous types d’emplois, de m’adapter rapidement à toutes sortes de situations, et de travailler en équipe. Mes nombreux stages m'ont appris à être responsable, autonome, et observer le déroulement quotidien au sein d'une agence et de travailler en équipe afin de concrétiser des projets très intéressants.
Je suis une designer d'intérieur et artiste peintre, passionnée par le design, l'architecture, le graphisme, la photographie, avec des compétences en arts, diplômée en design d'intérieure de l'école canadienne Collège LASALLE de Tunis.","Post

Association Youth Clubs · Part-time
The YOUTH CLUBs Association establishes clubs of pupils and students within high schools and universities located in Tunisia and equips them so that they each plead for a better education directly with their own educational community. Being a member of LPM Youth Club not only developed my social skills but also gave me the opportunity to work under supervision on senior on a national scale.
TITC is one the biggest projects I've worked on. I designed the visual brand identity and worked on sharing my knowledge with the community. I got to know many awesome people such as famous guests, professional speakers and talented group members. Not only have I developed my professional skills but I made a wide network in this group!

Good experience ! I enjoyed the people I worked with there. It was a friendly and fun atmosphere, and I actually enjoyed going to work each morning. I felt that the leadership team was great too. They knew all of their employees on a first name basis and tried to make those personal connections. I also enjoyed the fact that the office tried to do community outreach with local organizations.

Au cours de mes années à Collège LASALLE , j'ai été formée aux aménagements de diverses structures durant mes projets, ainsi que le développement d’objets quotidiens. De plus, la maîtrise de logiciels (Photoshop, Illustrator, Autocad, Sketchup, 3DS max, Adobe Première Pro), me donnent la possibilité d’optimiser mon travail.
About
Par ailleurs, ayant déjà travaillée dans la commercialisation, dans des boites d'architecture et maintenant en tant que designer et conceptrice de mobilier, me donnent la possibilité d’être polyvalente pour tous types d’emplois, de m’adapter rapidement à toutes sortes de situations, et de travailler en équipe. Mes nombreux stages m'ont appris à être responsable, autonome, et observer le déroulement quotidien au sein d'une agence et de travailler en équipe afin de concrétiser des projets très intéressants.
Je suis une designer d'intérieur et artiste peintre, passionnée par le design, l'architecture, le graphisme, la photographie, avec des compétences en arts, diplômée en design d'intérieure de l'école canadienne Collège LASALLE de Tunis.","Post
