Wajdi Makhlouf," Nabeul, Tunisia", Backend developer @Dejamobile,"used to watch my friends who were a big success in that time showing off their skills to me as I was very impressed. My path of learning has been achieved using any method that I found on the internet. Languages: Java, Typescript, java-script Frameworks: Spring, Angular, Symfony, Laravel I began my career with my end of studies's project with #symfony, and then I moved to #laravel due to it's popularity and simplicity. I then moved to the world of #java as the base programming language and later to #spring_boot as my web framework for developing #rest #apis. My passion carried me through my education at not only bachelor level, but also at engineer level where I learned many things about new programming languages, algorithms. And it was here where I learned that there was so much to learn yet. My #spring journey has continued to discover more and more like #spring_security #micro-services. …see more Then I added a #front-end touch to be able to do some front technologies, so I happened to choose #angular as it was backed by #google. Back in the days where my family couldn't afford to buy a computer, still I managed to get to know computers through public places and in school. Right now I am moving even further to #docker and I am willing to get an internship in these technologies. The web is everything to me and it's always been like that from the start. Due to the huge collection of frameworks and libraries available out there, one will have to sacrifice his lifetime to learn something new every two months or so.

This included implementing basic security policies, access control lists, and port security to prevent unauthorized access. During the Attack Phase, we conducted various types of attacks on our networking infrastructure including : - Router Exploitation (TheMoon RCE Exploit) ; Jul 2021 · 1 mo Skills: Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) · Wireshark · Threat and Vulnerability Management · Data Analysis · Python (Programming Language) · Network Traffic Analysis Tunis, Tunisia · Hybrid 5. Creating a Custom Function that will work with Levenshtein and take as input specefic TLSv1.3 fields that will identify clients in an even more reliable way. 1. Studying key differences between TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 to determine new available methods to identify a client without decryption. During this internship, I had the opportunity to acquire a diverse range of skills and knowledge in various areas of the industry. My primary focus was on web application vulnerabilities and exploitation, as well as basic pentesting, brute forcing, service, and Linux enumeration. By simulating real-world attacks, we were able to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the security architecture. During this internship, I had the opportunity to conduct a comprehensive analysis of data collected from TLS handshake logs. This analysis allowed me to identify key trends and patterns that informed the development of a new client identification function. CyberSecurity Internship Certificate of Completion Overall, the internship provided me with valuable practical experience and helped me to further develop my skills and competencies in the field of web development.

Through my future position, I intend to ensure compliance with tax and accounting standards by the files that I will be in charge of, but also to ensure consistent and accurate declarations. # Student # Taxation / Tax # Accounting #Jurist My motto ""Diversify your knowledge, be versatile and multiply your experiences."" From now on, professional experience counts more than training, so I remain open to any opportunity. You are certainly wondering why I chose this training? I also consider that a good tax expert must be able to reconcile taxation and accounting, which is why for a more complete training, I plan to do a second Master's degree in accounting and internships in the same field. About I also aim to diversify my areas of intervention after a few years of experience (tax inspector, accountant and consultant). I am then particularly interested in tax adjustments because I consider that the State must cover its expenses, meet social needs and that all taxpayers must discharge their tax obligations. Having a strong attraction for taxation and accounting, I intend to pursue a career after obtaining my Master's degree in Tax Law as a tax lawyer.","Experience Topic: Business in the digital age: tax impacts. - Declaration of personal income tax - Traditional permanent establishment and virtual permanent establishment Project supported with honors.

Sreekandh Balakrishnan,"     Bengaluru, Karnataka, India",     ❤️ technology transformation | change management," About But you know what really gets me going? Coaching and working with CXOs to become the best while working with technology. That's where my true passion lies. My journey with AWS (Cloud) started when I worked on an open-source project called Openbravo, and I got to travel to some pretty cool places like Barcelona and Chennai! I also worked at Yahoo and Adobe for a year, but I quickly realized that I work best when I'm close to the founder, business owner, or problem, rather than just focusing on code. Thanks again for reading! If you're interested in chatting more, let's connect! Just so you know, there's a limit to how much I can write here (2600 words, to be exact), but I'm down to chat more if you're up for it. What do you say? Let me know! I'm all about product development, building kick-ass engineering teams, change management, distributed teams, and re-engineering. I live and breathe this stuff, seriously! You can wake me up in the middle of the night and ask me questions about it. Throughout my career, I've accomplished a lot of milestones thanks to some amazing founders, friends, and partners. I've re-engineered stalled products in less than five months, scaled up sales teams with world-class mobile apps and backends, transformed e-commerce systems from manual to automated processes, and even designed a highly scalable digital signage system using Raspberry Pi. Plus, I've set up and scaled engineering (and non-engineering) teams in a few companies, and currently, I'm playing the role of India Director and Technology Director for Travelopia, which is owned by KKR. Let me tell you a bit about myself. I got my first taste of engineering when I was just 16 by helping out at my dad's machine manufacturing factory. But it wasn't until I took a summer class that I discovered my love for computer engineering. And let me tell you, I fell head over heels for open-source software! I spent all my free time tinkering with hardware, installing Linux, and trying out different Linux operating systems. After a while, I got pretty good at developing enterprise-grade application servers in Java and Python using Linux. I even became an expert in bash scripts and Python. But as much as I loved coding, I wanted to explore different types of businesses. That's why I started taking consulting roles. I worked with an early-stage venture capital firm and served as a technology advisor for a few portfolio companies.","Jan 2015 - Dec 2016 · 2 yrs Dec 2018 - Present · 4 yrs 5 mos Started by a few of us in a coffee shop, grew to become the world largest user group.
