Please keep up the good work and wish you all the best.
While talking about the work Kamel is doing, it's also very important to highlight that due to his constant focus, The proactive work he is delivering on a day to day basis, the ongoing topics remain completely under control and rarely have unexpected issues.
Recommendations
Executive Partner
I'm highlighting this, as this is a key expectation from a senior manager as Kamel.
Kamel is a competent manager who combines a high technical expertise with a Business acumen. Beside his capacity to support our customer in very complex project, Kamel is a take charge person who is able to provide a high standard of support as well as agile approach to improve services quality. I highly recommend this highly talented professional.
It was a pleasure to work together with Kamel MAZHOUDI, who was an excellent Customer Support Lead. He understands complicated issues even when outside of his direct area of expertise. For Kamel the job is obviously the most important thing to do. Excellent and result driven. Works towards maximal customer satisfaction. He was always able to successfully complete any tasks with favorable results despite deadline pressure. His hands-on strategy to leadership, management and powerful personality gained him the respect of the staff. Through the years, we worked on various projects and I was impressed by his manner of doing a great job. Definitely worth recommending.
I have had the opportunity to work with Kamel for the last few years, Kamel was very professional, customer focused and detail oriented.
