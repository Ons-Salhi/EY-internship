Her domain knowledge was very impressive and soon she became an indispensable part of the university. She is self-motivated with a strong personality, a caring person, and she gave importance to each detail. She knows how to manage both of her social and professional relationships in an effective manner.

She thoughtfully strives to match skills and personalities, and makes continuous efforts to connect with her clients and consultants. One of Ina’s core values is giving, which she incorporated into the business platform of her firm. P4P generously gives profits to charity with contributions made at the direction of her clients and consultants. This gives me an added sense of pride to work with Ina and represent P4P. I highly recommend working with her.
After only a referral from a recent acquaintance, Ina spent hours working with me to improve my public persona when I reentered the marketplace.
Her clients are lucky to have someone so dedicated to providing complete support to meet their staffing needs.

I have known and worked with Ina for over 12 years. We started out working on the same clients in San Francisco and then have partnered closely on various initiatives since she has moved to the East Coast. She is one of the hardest working people I have ever met. She is so organized and juggles many things effortlessly. I would work with Ina anywhere. She is truly amazing!

Kris has a excellent level or professionalism and was great in his early and often communication (how it should be). Kris has really set the bar in that regard in my experience when I've dealt with recruitment professionals in the past. He was able to think outside the box to ensure that all things worked out successfully. Without losing sight of results, he takes great personal interest in his clients to ensure that their needs are met. These for me are crucial deciding factors in choosing who I would want to represent me. Kris delivered in spades. Looking forward to the continued journey of working together in the future.","Follow

Serap is an outstanding leader who has a never ending supply of energy and positivity. She is an excellent professional with the highest integrity and understands how to leverage human capital to deliver strategy in complex cultural environments. What impresses me the most about Serap, is her ability to absorb huge quantities of information, assimilate it quickly and simplify problems to root elements. This coupled with an uncanny ability to spot talent and develop high performing teams makes her a top HR leader. I feel lucky to have had the chance to work with Serap and I sincerely hope we have the chance to work together again!!

I have been having the pleasure of working together with Serap as part of the management team for the last two years. Serap is a leader who has very strong communication skills. She is an active listener who always tries to understand others by also showing high level of empathy. When you deal with Serap, you realize that she actually “cares” for you and that she is ready to support you for any issues you may have. Serap and her HR team have taken several initiatives for the last few years which helped our organisation on improved staff engagement and motivation. In general the level of support we receive from HR is very satisfactory. I would recommend Serap both in terms of her personal skills and broad HR knowledge.

I feel incredibly fortunate to have attended St. Gerard’s. It is an incredible school, with amazing teachers, focusing on developing the whole person, academically, socially and spiritually. At St. Gerard’s I learned to be mindful, to be honest and to strive for success, three things I have and will continue to carry with me in all aspects of school life. I fully embraced every opportunity that came my way at St. Gerard’s, giving me the opportunity to participate and excel in a variety of areas; in sports, societies and academically whilst making life-long friends in the process.

In September 2020 I graduated from University College Dublin having studied a major in Economics and a minor in Social Policy. College life taught me to be ambitious, diligent and to always make a greater effort to achieve an outcome. I was fortunate enough to be chosen as a member of the C&E committee, UCD’s largest society. Planning networking events, making new friends and organising the C&E ball were amongst the highlights of my final year at UCD.
I chose to study this dynamic Masters programme as it blended marketing expertise and consumer driven innovation. I was inspired by the creativity, innovation and the relentless pace of change within different industries where integrating the new and old with the physical and digital is at the heart of it all. Through this masters programme I gained a comprehensive grounding in marketing which opened up my opportunities to embrace the data and technological changes occurring in industries which are transforming the retail sector all over the world. It helped me to develop new skills and to be inspired to reach the next level within my marketing career.

Alfredo me hizo cambiar la manera como miraba el Linkedin, mi CV y dar las entrevistas. Muy buen profesional y sobre todo un amigo que inspira confianza y ganas de dedicarle a la mejora continua.

Recomiendo y agradezco a Alfredo pues es un capo en empleabilidad. Tuve la oportunidad de conocerlo cuando participé en uno de sus talleres, donde me dió el feedback necesario para reconocer mi valor agregado y desarrollar entrevistas laborales estratégicas, lo cual fue clave para que yo pueda recolocarme laboralmente.

Avril is an extremely efficient and organised member of the People Operations (HR) group at Google. She has had a variety of roles and remits at Google - from working on the technical staffing team as an RC, to working as an analyst and also helping to facilitate our offer process. I worked with Avril as a peer, and I've also managed her directly. She is a fantastic team member with a real ""get things done"" attitude, and I'd recommend her highly for a variety of roles within HR and Staffing.
Jonathan Barker
Avril was an outstanding CSR in her time with AXA Insurance. She made a name for herself very quickly amongst her peers, and I believed from very early on that she was grasping the opportunity presented, and was destined for greater things. I have no doubt that Avril will be a success in whatever arena and role she chooses to work in.

Dear All, 
I am deeply grateful for the incredible people I have met through my professional and personal Life, have always attracted top notch Thinkers to myself as Mentors and Inspirers. I fully acknowledge that what I do and say as Speaker/ Faculty is hugely and positively impacted by all these remarkable Influencers, and that I stand on the shoulders of so many Thought Leaders, Researchers and deep Thinkers…
Dr Sujaya Banerjee
I have often through my professional journey of over 32 years been asked why I didn’t have a Blog. My response had always been that I already speak to several professionals through my interactions, change agendas and workshops. I also lead 2 not for profits - the Learning and OD Roundtable and the Women Leadership Forum of Asia. I also have a Vision for touching the lives of 1 Million professionals, and impacting them positively, which is staring at me on my Vision Board and I know there are miles to go……
Regards,
This Blog has my best Articles, videos, Ted talks, the Poems that inspire me, my recommended List of books to read, all the themes I Speak on and more…I plan to use this an avenue for constantly sharing all that I am Learning, Writing, Reading and getting inspired by!
