About
About
I have been growing with a big interest and hunger for the IT field since the first touch of a computer. While pursuing an Engineering degree at the National Institute of Applied Science and Technology (INSAT), I have developed skills in cyber security and ethical hacking: Cryptography, Penetration Testing, Networks Infrastructures Security and Competetive Programming. This knowledge has enabled me to operate in Windows and Linux platforms and master multiple security, programming principles and concepts.
Being an active member in Clubs and associations helped me developing soft skills as well as hard skills. Organizing events, leading staff helped me gain the sense of leadership, team group, handling deadlines : lead the staff to implement an idea, raise the bar of motivation.
