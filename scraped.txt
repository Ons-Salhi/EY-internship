About
Développeuse j'ai effectué un stage dans le développement Web , et une première expérience professionnelle en MM.
J'ai pu pratiquer le développement (en HTML/CSS, Javascript, PHP et bien d'autres), l'organisation de projets (à l'aide de méthodes Agiles), la documentation et la maintenance d'applications et de sites Web ( e commerce avec prestashop)
Féru d'informatique et ouvert d'esprit, je suis en recherche d'opportunités qui me grandiront personnellement et professionnellement.
J'ai soif de connaissances, et n'attends que de m'engager dans un projet qui me laissera la chance d'exprimer ma motivation et mes compétences.
L’informatique me permet de rassembler mes savoir-être acquis :
- En tant que chargée projet web : rigueur, résolution de problèmes, développement d’un projet

L’informatique est un secteur très riche, dynamique, parfait pour mon besoin de curiosité et d’épanouissement, l’envie d’apprendre de nouvelles choses de jour en jour.

February 17, 2023,Mohamed Rachedworked withAhmedon the same team
I am delighted to have the opportunity to write a recommendation for Ahmed, a highly skilled and talented ReactJS and NextJS frontend developer. I have had the pleasure of working closely with Ahmed for 7 months now , and I can say without hesitation that he is a valuable asset to any team.
Ahmed has a strong grasp of the ReactJS framework and demonstrates excellent problem-solving skills when it comes to building complex frontend applications. His technical abilities are truly impressive, and he consistently delivers high-quality work that exceeds expectations. I have been consistently impressed by his ability to write clean, maintainable, and efficient code, as well as his knack for troubleshooting and debugging.
But beyond his technical skills, Ahmed is a wonderful coworker and an outstanding friend. He is always willing to lend a helping hand, both to his colleagues and to our clients. His positive attitude, strong work ethic, and attention to detail make him an ideal team player. I have seen firsthand how his contributions have improved our team's workflow and morale, and I believe that any organisation would be lucky to have him on board.
In summary, I highly recommend Ahmed for any ReactJS and NextJS frontend development role. He is an incredibly talented developer and an even better person, and I am confident that he will excel in any challenge he takes on.

Le calme est l’expression qui me vient à l’esprit quand je pense à Ahmed. J’ai eu le plaisir de connaître Ahmed Chebil pour 1 an, au cours duquel on a partagé le même bureau et le même projet.
Surtout, j’ai été impressionné par la capacité de résoudre les problèmes liés aux Front End. Et, bien sûr, son calme qui est appréciable. Ahmed serait un véritable atout pour tous les postes nécessitant un développeur web qui fait travaille entre le Back End et le Front End.

About
About
Professional Python Developer with experience in working as a python/Django Developer since beginning.
Skilled in implementing web applications, API & PMS integrations.
During this period I gained technical knowledge in developing, testing and implementing web solutions for our clients, critical thinking, project management and team work with successful results and ability to rapidly learn.
Flourishing in one's current environment does not mean refraining from other ambitious challenges, so it is only natural that I remain open to any proposal that would allow me to capitalize on my achievements while continuing my progress.

About
About
I'm way into computers.

I've always been fond of playing video games, solving mysteries, and destroying the enemy. Which became a part of my personality growing up. Every year goes by, I learn new facts about computer science. But still felt like something is missing.

And that's when it happened; the spark that was missing ignited the instant I enrolled in a college that specializes in computer science.
The courses I took, really called to all my passions; it incorporates creativity, and problem-solving. I'm also allowed to plan the tasks that I will be doing, and expect a certain result.

I learned enough in theory and I got to practice it in different occasions with different companies. That really put me in the mood to get better and learn more about professional life.

About
I am a web developer with a passion for creating user-friendly and dynamic websites. With over 5 years of experience in web development, I have developed a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.

My expertise extends beyond basic web development. I specialize in creating bespoke websites and web applications that are tailored to meet the specific needs of my clients. From front-end design to back-end development, I am well-versed in a range of technologies, including React, Node.js, WordPress, and more.

I have worked on a diverse range of projects including e-commerce websites, responsive web design, and web application development. Additionally, I have experience in CMS development, API integration, database design and management, payment gateway integration, and performance optimization.

My focus is on delivering high-quality, efficient, and reliable solutions to my clients that are tailored to their exact requirements. I am constantly learning new and innovative ways to enhance my clients' online presence and always strive to exceed their expectations.

If you're looking for a skilled and dedicated web developer who can help you achieve your web development goals, let's get in touch and discuss your project.

It is really rare to come across someone so talented in his job as Ramzi.
I worked with Ramzi for a good period now and I can say proudly that in that short period I learned a lot from him thanks to his great patience, talent and knowledge.
and if I get the chance to work him again I will absolutely do it in with a happy heart.
As a team member, Ramzi earns my highest recommendation.
