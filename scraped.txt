December 1, 2022,AnismanagedHamzadirectly
En tant que directeur de communication, j'ai eu Hamza Ltaief au sein de mon équipe pendant 1 an et 9 mois en tant que graphic & motion designer sous ma supervision directe.
Hamza s'est adapté très rapidement à un marché qui lui était nouveau grâce à sa capacité d'écoute, ses qualités humaines et son professionnalisme.
Hamza est une personne sérieuse, disponible, organisée et créative.
je peux assurer sans une once de doute qu'il se montrera tout autant efficace au sein de vos équipes et pour la réalisation de vos projets.

About
About
Hello! As a graphic designer, I had the chance to study advertising graphic design at the higher school of science and technology of design, where I was able to refine my skills in the subtle art of graphic creation. Passionate about the creative disciplines of brand design, I have a predilection for collaborative teamwork, which provides fertile ground for innovative ideas and optimal professional growth.
My mission is to understand the needs and goals of my clients and create designs that align with their branding and marketing strategies using visual elements such as typography, color, and images to resonate with the intended audience and drive the desired action or response.

Working as a Social Media Manager at JCI Medenine (Cellule Junior) gave me the opportunity to design a visual identity for a rigorous club and receive feedback from seniors as well. This is going to be surely a huge add up to my professional career as a Graphic Designer.

TITC is one the biggest projects I've worked on. I designed the visual brand identity and worked on sharing my knowledge with the community. I got to know many awesome people such as famous guests, professional speakers and talented group members. Not only have I developed my professional skills but I made a wide network in this group!

The YOUTH CLUBs Association establishes clubs of pupils and students within high schools and universities located in Tunisia and equips them so that they each plead for a better education directly with their own educational community. Being a member of LPM Youth Club not only developed my social skills but also gave me the opportunity to work under supervision on senior on a national scale.

About
About
Je suis une designer d'intérieur et artiste peintre, passionnée par le design, l'architecture, le graphisme, la photographie, avec des compétences en arts, diplômée en design d'intérieure de l'école canadienne Collège LASALLE de Tunis.

Au cours de mes années à Collège LASALLE , j'ai été formée aux aménagements de diverses structures durant mes projets, ainsi que le développement d’objets quotidiens. De plus, la maîtrise de logiciels (Photoshop, Illustrator, Autocad, Sketchup, 3DS max, Adobe Première Pro), me donnent la possibilité d’optimiser mon travail.

Par ailleurs, ayant déjà travaillée dans la commercialisation, dans des boites d'architecture et maintenant en tant que designer et conceptrice de mobilier, me donnent la possibilité d’être polyvalente pour tous types d’emplois, de m’adapter rapidement à toutes sortes de situations, et de travailler en équipe. Mes nombreux stages m'ont appris à être responsable, autonome, et observer le déroulement quotidien au sein d'une agence et de travailler en équipe afin de concrétiser des projets très intéressants.

𝐑𝐚𝐲 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐠
𝐑𝐚𝐲 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐠is a technique that has been used in computer graphics for many years. It involves simulating the path of light rays in a 3D scene in order to generate a 2D image that appears to be a photograph of the scene. The technique was first described by 𝐀𝐫𝐭𝐡𝐮𝐫 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐥 in 1968, and has since been used in a wide range of applications, from video games to special effects in movies.
In ray tracing, a single ray of light is traced from the viewer's eye through each pixel on the screen and into the scene. The ray is then tested for intersection with objects in the scene, and the color of the object at the intersection point is used to determine the color of the pixel. Although it is fast and efficient, ray tracing only simulates direct lighting and does not take into account indirect illumination or global illumination.
For more information about ray tracing, you can check out this article on Wikipedia:)
𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐡 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐠
𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐡 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐠 is a more sophisticated technique that simulates the behavior of light by tracing multiple rays from the camera into the scene and tracking how they bounce off objects in the scene. The color of the pixel is determined by averaging the colors of all the rays that contribute to it. Path tracing takes into account indirect illumination and global illumination, producing more realistic images with soft shadows, reflections, and refractions.
Path tracing was first described by 𝐉𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐬 𝐊𝐚𝐣𝐢𝐲𝐚 𝐢𝐧 1986, and has since become a popular technique in the field of computer graphics. It is used in many applications, from animation and film production to architectural visualization and video game development.
For more information about path tracing, you can check out this article on Wikipedia:

𝐑𝐚𝐲 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐠
𝐑𝐚𝐲 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐠is a technique that has been used in computer graphics for many years. It involves simulating the path of light rays in a 3D scene in order to generate a 2D image that appears to be a photograph of the scene. The technique was first described by 𝐀𝐫𝐭𝐡𝐮𝐫 𝐀𝐩𝐩𝐞𝐥 in 1968, and has since been used in a wide range of applications, from video games to special effects in movies.
In ray tracing, a single ray of light is traced from the viewer's eye through each pixel on the screen and into the scene. The ray is then tested for intersection with objects in the scene, and the color of the object at the intersection point is used to determine the color of the pixel. Although it is fast and efficient, ray tracing only simulates direct lighting and does not take into account indirect illumination or global illumination.
For more information about ray tracing, you can check out this article on Wikipedia:)
𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐡 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐠
𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐡 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐠 is a more sophisticated technique that simulates the behavior of light by tracing multiple rays from the camera into the scene and tracking how they bounce off objects in the scene. The color of the pixel is determined by averaging the colors of all the rays that contribute to it. Path tracing takes into account indirect illumination and global illumination, producing more realistic images with soft shadows, reflections, and refractions.
Path tracing was first described by 𝐉𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐬 𝐊𝐚𝐣𝐢𝐲𝐚 𝐢𝐧 1986, and has since become a popular technique in the field of computer graphics. It is used in many applications, from animation and film production to architectural visualization and video game development.

The goal of the club is to form the nucleus of a programming community 🌐 in the south of Tunisia and to embrace young talents in the absence of similar activities and clubs.

Working as a Social Media Manager at JCI Medenine (Cellule Junior) gave me the opportunity to design a visual identity for a rigorous club and receive feedback from seniors as well. This is going to be surely a huge add up to my professional career as a Graphic Designer.

TITC is one the biggest projects I've worked on. I designed the visual brand identity and worked on sharing my knowledge with the community. I got to know many awesome people such as famous guests, professional speakers and talented group members. Not only have I developed my professional skills but I made a wide network in this group!

The YOUTH CLUBs Association establishes clubs of pupils and students within high schools and universities located in Tunisia and equips them so that they each plead for a better education directly with their own educational community. Being a member of LPM Youth Club not only developed my social skills but also gave me the opportunity to work under supervision on senior on a national scale.

Good experience ! I enjoyed the people I worked with there. It was a friendly and fun atmosphere, and I actually enjoyed going to work each morning. I felt that the leadership team was great too. They knew all of their employees on a first name basis and tried to make those personal connections. I also enjoyed the fact that the office tried to do community outreach with local organizations.

About
About
Je suis une designer d'intérieur et artiste peintre, passionnée par le design, l'architecture, le graphisme, la photographie, avec des compétences en arts, diplômée en design d'intérieure de l'école canadienne Collège LASALLE de Tunis.

Au cours de mes années à Collège LASALLE , j'ai été formée aux aménagements de diverses structures durant mes projets, ainsi que le développement d’objets quotidiens. De plus, la maîtrise de logiciels (Photoshop, Illustrator, Autocad, Sketchup, 3DS max, Adobe Première Pro), me donnent la possibilité d’optimiser mon travail.

Par ailleurs, ayant déjà travaillée dans la commercialisation, dans des boites d'architecture et maintenant en tant que designer et conceptrice de mobilier, me donnent la possibilité d’être polyvalente pour tous types d’emplois, de m’adapter rapidement à toutes sortes de situations, et de travailler en équipe. Mes nombreux stages m'ont appris à être responsable, autonome, et observer le déroulement quotidien au sein d'une agence et de travailler en équipe afin de concrétiser des projets très intéressants.

December 1, 2022,AnismanagedHamzadirectly
En tant que directeur de communication, j'ai eu Hamza Ltaief au sein de mon équipe pendant 1 an et 9 mois en tant que graphic & motion designer sous ma supervision directe.
Hamza s'est adapté très rapidement à un marché qui lui était nouveau grâce à sa capacité d'écoute, ses qualités humaines et son professionnalisme.
Hamza est une personne sérieuse, disponible, organisée et créative.
je peux assurer sans une once de doute qu'il se montrera tout autant efficace au sein de vos équipes et pour la réalisation de vos projets.
