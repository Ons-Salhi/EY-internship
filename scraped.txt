To reduce needed resources to upgrade Marquardt domain devices to the latest windows 10 Feature update, a PowerShell tool is used along with Ivanti Endpoint Manager web service, Cisco ISE web service and Excel PowerShell module to automate all the process. This way local IT in different locations can use just one single Excel file to monitor progress of windows 10 upgrade in their locations.
- Cisco ISE API : needed to grant access to devices during upgrade process in case Network Access is not granted due to any issue (missed certifiate, etc)
- Ivanti EPM web service : to retrieve information about the device, create a provisioning job (upgrade job), upgrade some software, etc

Conception et développement d'un outil de couverture dynamique "optimisée" en delta d'un portefeuille de produits dérivés sur action.
En effet, au sein des banques d'investissement, la couverture en delta des portefeuilles d'actifs financiers est obligatoire. Ainsi, les traders ont comme principale mission de fournir de manière continue la couverture en delta de leurs portefeuilles respectives.

Dans le but de fournir une assistance aux traders sur produits dérivés, l'application que nous souhaitons développée propose aux traders les informations suivantes:

- Le calcul du delta global cash par sous-jacent et donc l'équivalent en nombre de sous-jacents à acheter ou à vendre pour couvrir ce risque.
- Le cout du risque en estimant un mouvement des sous-jacents égal au quantil négatif 90% des mouvements journaliers historiques sur un an.
- Le coût de la couverture mesuré comme étant la moitié du chemin entre le prix d'achat et le prix de vente. On ajoute les commissions pour calculer le coût total.
Technologies : JEE 6 ( JSF « Primefaces » , EJB, JPA), jquery, Ajax et CSS3

It was a pleasure to work together with Kamel MAZHOUDI, who was an excellent Customer Support Lead. He understands complicated issues even when outside of his direct area of expertise. For Kamel the job is obviously the most important thing to do. Excellent and result driven. Works towards maximal customer satisfaction. He was always able to successfully complete any tasks with favorable results despite deadline pressure. His hands-on strategy to leadership, management and powerful personality gained him the respect of the staff. Through the years, we worked on various projects and I was impressed by his manner of doing a great job. Definitely worth recommending.

I have had the opportunity to work with Kamel for the last few years, Kamel was very professional, customer focused and detail oriented.
He has shown massive patience, communication skill level and customer focus while working complex use cases and customer relationships.

While talking about the work Kamel is doing, it's also very important to highlight that due to his constant focus, The proactive work he is delivering on a day to day basis, the ongoing topics remain completely under control and rarely have unexpected issues.
I'm highlighting this, as this is a key expectation from a senior manager as Kamel.

Last but not least, Kamel is a true asset for supporting and developing the accurate strategy in close relationship with the company vision.
Please keep up the good work and wish you all the best.

Cheers

C'est un vrai leader qui permet à ses ingénieurs d'être toujours à jour sur les nouvelles technologies en leur donnant une marge de responsabilité et l'opportunité de proposer et de prendre des risques tout en leur encadrant sur les bonnes pratiques de gestion de leur travail et d'amélioration de la qualité de leurs livrables.
J'ai travaille sous sa responsabilité pendant plus que 8 ans et cela m'a permis bien de m'évoluer techniquement sur plusieurs sujets.
