Adam Kafia,"      Ariana, Tunisia",      Software engineer | NestJS developer | Backend developer,"
As a highly skilled backend developer and software engineer with over 700 hours of experience as a freelancer, I specialize in developing and maintaining scalable and reliable server-side systems using NodeJS, Express, NestJS, API, Rest API, MongoDB, Mongoose, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, with a strong focus on cloud technologies such as AWS and GCP. I am also experienced in using Tauri to build fast, secure, and scalable desktop applications.
I am looking to connect with like-minded professionals and explore new opportunities in the backend development field, with a focus on cloud technologies such as AWS and GCP, as well as building desktop applications with Tauri.
I have a track record of success in delivering high-quality, scalable solutions to complex problems as a freelancer on Upwork. In my previous roles, I have developed and maintained a range of server-side systems, including a serverless event-driven architecture for a real-time messaging platform and a secure authentication system using JSON Web Tokens. I have extensive experience working with CI/CD pipelines on both Bitbucket and GitHub, and am skilled in implementing automated testing and deployment processes to ensure the timely delivery of high-quality software. I am also familiar with Atlassian Jira and Confluence, and have experience using these tools to manage project workflows and collaborate with team members.

Given
Ali is one of the hardest-working people I know. His skills of identifying problems and coming up with solutions is very remarkable. Don't let his ""Tryna be serious"" first impression deceive you, he's a really fun person (like really fun). He wasn't my closest colleague, but whenever we talk or work on something together, he always has something great to bring to the table. Lastly, one of his best qualities in my opinion is how he provides critics and feedback in a very gentle and non-offensive way.

bonne chance mon amie .
J’ai eu le plaisir de travailler avec anis pendant trois mois de stage à la Société , en collaborant sur le projet développement d'une application web de gestion d'une Park automobile.
Anis est mon étudiant depuis l'année 2019. J’ai été particulièrement impressionnée par son sérieux et sa motivation à apprendre. C'est une personne proactive qui s’implique réellement dans son travail. Toujours curieux et ouvert d’esprit, Anis a un réel goût pour les défis ! Je remarque considérablement ses compétences qui se développent de plus en plus. Anis est un atout pour n’importe quelle équipe. Je le recommande !

Wajdi Makhlouf,"      Nabeul, Tunisia",      Backend developer @Dejamobile,"I used to watch my friends who were a big success in that time showing off their skills to me as I was very impressed.
My path of learning has been achieved using any method that I found on the internet.
Languages: Java, Typescript, java-script
Frameworks: Spring, Angular, Symfony, Laravel
I began my career with my end of studies's project with #symfony, and then I moved to #laravel due to it's popularity and simplicity.
I then moved to the world of #java as the base programming language and later to #spring_boot as my web framework for developing #rest #apis.
My passion carried me through my education at not only bachelor level, but also at engineer level where I learned many things about new programming languages, algorithms. And it was here where I learned that there was so much to learn yet.
My #spring journey has continued to discover more and more like #spring_security #micro-services.
…see more
Then I added a #front-end touch to be able to do some front technologies, so I happened to choose #angular as it was backed by #google.
Back in the days where my family couldn't afford to buy a computer, still I managed to get to know computers through public places and in school.
Right now I am moving even further to #docker and I am willing to get an internship in these technologies.
The web is everything to me and it's always been like that from the start. Due to the huge collection of frameworks and libraries available out there, one will have to sacrifice his lifetime to learn something new every two months or so.
